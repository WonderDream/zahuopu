AI_generate_poems.py is a brief example for seq2seq model implemented using tensorflow/tensorlayer.
Since the examples from the tutorial is quit complicated for the beginners like me, I hope such a toy example will be helpfull.
However, the manual of tensorlayer API is a little confusing, so I'm not sure I used them properly, even though the code seems to work.
